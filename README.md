## Introduction
The Pharmacy Management System is designed to automate and streamline the operations of a pharmacy shop. It handles inventory management, sales transactions, and analytics to improve efficiency and customer service.

## Problem Statement
Traditional pharmacy management relies heavily on manual processes for inventory tracking, sales recording, and analytics. This leads to inefficiencies, errors in stock management, and difficulties in generating accurate sales reports.

## Main Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a robust Pharmacy Management System that automates inventory management, tracks sales transactions, and provides analytical insights into sales and stock levels.

## Specific Objectives
1. Implement a database-driven system for managing medicine stock with features for adding, updating, and removing inventory.
2. Develop a user-friendly interface for processing sales, generating receipts, and maintaining transaction history.
3. Incorporate analytics features to track out-of-stock items, total sales, and sales trends over different time intervals.
4. Ensure the system is scalable, secure, and responsive to meet the needs of a growing pharmacy business.

## Methodology
The project will be developed using a combination of web technologies, including PHP for server-side scripting, MySQL for database management, HTML/CSS for front-end development, and JavaScript for dynamic user interactions. The system will follow a structured approach with iterative development, testing, and deployment phases.

## Used Technology
- **Backend**: PHP, MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Scripting**: JavaScript, jQuery
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Other Tools**: AJAX for asynchronous data handling, Bootstrap for responsive design, and FontAwesome for icons.

## Structured Analysis
1. **Database Design**: Design normalized tables for `medicine_stock`, `sold_items`, and `out_of_stock` to maintain data integrity and facilitate efficient querying.
2. **User Interface**: Develop intuitive user interfaces using Bootstrap to ensure accessibility and ease of use.
3. **Functionality**: Implement CRUD operations for managing inventory, processing sales, and generating analytical reports.
4. **Security**: Ensure data security with secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and application code to handle large datasets and concurrent user requests efficiently.

## Conclusion
The Pharmacy Management System aims to modernize pharmacy operations, improve service delivery, and provide actionable insights through data analytics. By leveraging technology, pharmacies can enhance operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
